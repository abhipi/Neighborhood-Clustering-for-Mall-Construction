# Neighborhood-Clustering-for-Mall-Construction
* This repository contains the code for a project focused on neighborhood clustering for mall construction in Mumbai, India, using the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. The main aim is to use data analysis techniques to group neighborhoods based on various criteria and identify optimal locations for building malls.
* The segmentation.ipynb file contains the main code for the project. It is a Jupyter Notebook that guides you through the process of neighborhood clustering for mall construction step-by-step. You can execute the cells sequentially to understand the code and results.
* Completed as part of the Applied Data Science Captone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
