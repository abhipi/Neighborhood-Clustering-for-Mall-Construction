        "*Shopping is a great way for tourists as well as locals to enjoy,relax and treat themselves to something new and exciting. This activity has become extremely popular in recent times. Although life was brought to a standstill due to the Coronavirus pandemic,in a lot of countries, including India, shops have begun opening up, resulting in the return of this trend. Property developers are also taking advantage of this to tap into the enormous market out there. As a result, Mumbai, the commercial capital of India, has a ton of shopping centres, and numerous ones are being currently constructed. These malls allow developers to have a consistent income.However, not all malls are successful; their locations also have to be taken into consideration.This factor is what truly determines a mall's success or failure.*"
